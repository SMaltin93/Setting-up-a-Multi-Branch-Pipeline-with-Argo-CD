# Argo CD Multi-Branch Pipeline Setup

Welcome to the Argo CD tutorial! In this scenario, you will learn how to set up and deploy two pipelines (for the main and dev branches) using Argo CD.

- You'll prepare the repository and create necessary files.
- Then, you'll configure Argo CD to automatically deploy changes to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites:
- You should have a basic understanding of Git, YAML, and Kubernetes.

Let's get started!


### **Step 4: Log In to Argo CD (step4/text.md)**
