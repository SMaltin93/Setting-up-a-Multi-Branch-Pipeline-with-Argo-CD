# Congratulations!

You've successfully set up and deployed pipelines in Argo CD! Feel free to keep experimenting in this virtual-machine. Push new images, push changes to your manifests and see how Argo CD automatically applies them. Also, now you have to separate deployent pipes that you can use for different stages of your development.

### Recap:
- You prepared the repository.
- You created two pipeline configurations for `main` and `dev` branches.
- You applied these configurations in Argo CD.
- You logged into the Argo CD dashboard and verified the deployments.
