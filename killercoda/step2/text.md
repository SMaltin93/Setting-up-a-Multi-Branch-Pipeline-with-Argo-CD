# The configuration
Following, we will configure a dummy web-app, nothing too complex.


## 1. application.yaml
In the `argo-cd/application.yaml` file, add the following configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: dummy-webapp-production
  namespace: argocd
  annotations:
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list: webapp=noizysthlm/dummy-webapp:prod
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/update-strategy: digest
    argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/write-back-method: git
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/noizy-sthlm/dummyWeb-ArgoCDk8s.git
    targetRevision: main
    path: manifests/
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: dummy-webapp-production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```
As you see, ArgoCD applications are configured using the same yaml style manifest as any other Kubernetes component. Some fields of interest here are `spec.source.repoURL` which is the location for the desired state which ArgoCD should 

**!>Change spec.source.repoURL to a public repository of yours (you should have forked or created one in the previous step)!<**


## 2. webapp-deployment.yaml
Write the following configuration to `manifests/frontendwebapp-deployment.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dummy-webapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: dummy-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dummy-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dummy-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: noizysthlm/dummy-webapp:prod   #This
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
```


## 3. webapp-service.yaml
Write to `manifests/webapp-service.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dummy-webapp-service 
spec:
  selector:
    app: dummy-webapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8888
    targetPort: 5000
```

## 4. kustomization.yaml
```yaml
#Kustomize to enable argo-cd-image-updater to write back new tags
resources:
  - webapp-deployment.yaml
  - webapp-service.yaml

images:
  - name: noizysthlm/dummy-webapp
    newTag: "prod"
```


>**NOTE**
>For this tutorial, we have provided you with two images on Docker hub for you to use. If you would prefer however, you could edit the configuration to fit another image of your liking. You could also fork the application from ... and edit it to your liking and push it to your own image registry instead.

# A development branch
## 4. Time to create a dev branch
After we have completed the setup for our production branch we need to set up our development branch. This is where the developers will push new iterations of their application, to test in an isolated environment befor merging any changes with the main branch. It's not any more complex than a `git checkout -b dev` and a few tweaks of our configuration

Now we modify some parameters to fit in to our dev pipe

In `argo-cd/application.yaml` edit the application name,`spec.source.targetRevision`, and the target namespace `spec.destination.namespace`:
```yaml
metadata:
  name: dummy-webapp-development  #Here
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: webapp
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
    targetRevisio: dev            #Here
    path: manifests/
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: dummy-webapp-development #Here
.
.
.
```

...and `targetPort` in `manifests/services/webapp-service.yaml`
```yaml
â«¶
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9999  #This
```

**OPS!!!! Don't forget to push the changes to your repository**
