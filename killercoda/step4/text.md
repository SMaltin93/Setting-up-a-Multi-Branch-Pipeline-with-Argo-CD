### Instructions:

1. **Open the Traffic/Port menu**:
   - In the top right of the screen, click on the **Traffic/Port** menu.

2. **Access the Argo CD dashboard**:
   - Click on the link for **Port 8080** to open the Argo CD dashboard in your browser.

3. **Log in to Argo CD**:
   Use the following credentials to log in:
   
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `$admin_password`

4. **Verify your applications**:
   - After logging in, verify that the applications for both the `main` and `development` branches are listed.
   - Check the sync status of each application to ensure that Argo CD is correctly applying your manifests from the GitHub repository.

Once you're logged in, you can manage your pipelines, monitor deployments, and automate your CI/CD process through Argo CD.
