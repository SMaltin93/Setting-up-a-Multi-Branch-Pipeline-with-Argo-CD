## Step 1: Set Up the Repository

In this step, you will:

- Create a GitHub repository to store your manifests.
- Set up two branches, `main` and `dev`.

### Instructions:

1. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository.
2. Clone the repository into your KillerCoda environment:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```

3. Create two branches for the pipeline:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b main
   git checkout -b dev
   ```

Once you've created the branches, click **Next**.
